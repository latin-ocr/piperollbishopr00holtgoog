Miss Levett¹ have discussed this point in some detail, and little that
is new can be added. Briefly, then, we my note that the purposos
οἱ a medieval aooount roll and a rnodem balance sheet are funda—
mental-ly dissimilar. Whilst the one seeks to indicate the extent to
which the manorial officia-l has {ulfilled his obligations toward his
lord, the other seeks to show the siae oi a profit or loss over a given
period. From this distinction it becomes obvious that we cannot take
the net balance, appear-ing at the end oi every account, as indicative
ot profit or loss. Α debit rnay indicate either bad debts aocruing over
a period of years, and inherited hy the reeve (rom his predecessor, or,
as was often the case with sheriffs rendering aer-mint at Westminster,
money held in neserve to meet any unexpeeted expenditure during
the few weeks atter the audit. On the other hand, a surplus. treated
as showing a profit. is completely rnisleading. ior it will often include
artears from previous years. Other iactors. as Denbolm-Young has
shown, must be reckoned with md every item oi the account must
be submitted to a most caretul serutiny before we ure in a position to
declare the precise profit or loss sustained on any one mmor. The
rnedieval account was idaeJJy constructed to reveal at a glanoe the
responsibility οὶ the accounting officials, and how tar these responsi-
bilitioe were discharged. In an economy that was only just becoming
geared to the idea οἱ productiori for a market on any appreciable
scale. profit and loss were not oi primary concern to a lord, whereas
his relations with his manorial officials* and the efficiency with which
they performed their customary dun-s, were.

The manuscript contains a great deal oi variatim-i in the spelling
oi place-names. Where the saihe has clearly indicated his preference
tor a particular iorrn, this forrn, however inconsistent with previous
spellings. has been kept. In cases where place-namus have been
severely abbreviated the spelling followed has been that used in the
heading ot an account, or in the list oi names at the toot of eaeh
membmne. In the Winehester account the scribe prefers the spelling
‘stret' to ‘strete’ (ie. Flosmangmstret, Garstret, Tannerestret). The
intinized {orins oi Anglo-Saxon personal names have not been pre-
served, except in casas where there is a clear indication to the con-
trary. The genitive and abletive toi-ins oi Adam. Ade and Adii,
occur in the roll but not with any consistency and the fonn. Adam.
is frequently used in place ot both cases. Perhaps the knottiest prob-
lern that has had to be laced has been the indiscriminate abbreviation
of the words ¹1enamentum’, ‘terrum’, ‘iermsss ‘terreus' and ‘ferrum'
as feff. Whilst 'terrun' is occasionally written in the manuscript as
