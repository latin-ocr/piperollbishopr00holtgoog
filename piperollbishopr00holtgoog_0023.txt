‘serm-1¹, and 'ferramentum' as fen-affl, the real prublem has been to
choose between ‘ferramentum’ and 'iai-rum· used in a particular con-
text, and abbreviated as feff. 'Feri-amentum eamee' and ‘ferrum
mruoe' both rnean a ploughshare. Taln'ng our cue from the occasional
abbreviation of the former as (ezraii-t, that ionn, the meaning oi
which Hau extends iu bis edition to cover all the iron parts οἱ a
plough, has been used in practically every case.¹ Throughout the
transcription the singular tornis ’ἀπίει-ιε’, 'liberatione' and ‘con-
suetudine' have been used. In his edition Hall uses both the singular
and the plural forms of all three, though he may be iollnwing the
original: but the singular form ‘decima' explains itself, and ‘con-
suetudine' is regarded as the ‘eustorii' oi a maner, rather than the
‘castonis' of individual recipients oi customary allowances. Sirnilarly
‘liberationez livery, has been regarded as a tota-l quantity to be
deducted frorn the yearly produce, irrespeetive oi the number uf
recipients between whom it was divided.

section of some 01 the accounts. From this scanty infoxmation two
main laets emerge. The bishop's finano& were founded on a view
taken in the mid-year, and on a centralized audit.

For the officials nn the winchester estates, Midiaelxnas marked
the end οἱ one financial year and the beginning oi the next. Irn-
mediately alter Michaelsnas the accounts were presented for audit ;
but long before this stage was reached, a great deal of preliminary
work had been done in the taking oi the view. Denholin-Young has
described in son-ie detail the differeneae between the view and the
audit ni an account, using as illusnation evidence imni the Fortibus
and Bigod astatus in the late thirteen-*h century¹ Briefly, the view
was an interim finaneial repert prepared in mid-year tn facilitate the
compilation oi the account roll at the end oi the finaneial year. Per-
haps Walter οἰ Henley explains the object 01 the view most sue-
einetly: 'View ot account was rnade to know ssiestate 01 things as well
