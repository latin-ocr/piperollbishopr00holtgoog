bishop in Tadley, in the hundred of 0verton.¹ But, like other oi the
bishop's knights, he is vitally conoerned with his lord's financial
affairs. During 1210-11 he twioe held a view at Wargrave tor which
his expensee were again paid* Bearing this in mind, it seems rnore
than likely that Robert came to southwark to sit as oue oi the
bar-ons of the exchequer.

In conclusion we must say a word about the two officials most
intimately conces-ned with the bishop’s finanoes—John the Dean, the
bishop's treasnrer, and Danas, his chamberlain. John the Dean
appears in other capacia& but his most important function is that .
of treasum. and of the two officials he is the more important- He
reoeivae in most casos the whole net receipts from the reeve of each
manor. We have no record οἱ any disbursements made by him* as any
cash allowanoae made for the reem were deducted {rom their
ieoeipts and not taken out of the centra] excheqner. Unlike the
monk—deans of Lewe: Priory, John does not appear to have had
either his own seal, or to have been witness to any ol the few remain-
ing episcopal chartam! Like his successor in the later thirteenth
century! John appears as the person responsible iot provisioning the
bisbep’s nsidenoe, the castle of Wolveeey. and the evidence suggests
that Wolvssey was une οἱ the bishop's treas-irim, as it certainly was
at the end οἱ the eenrury.⁵ It is uniortunate that one of the most
important oi the hishop's administrativa officials must remain in
such obscurity.

The identity and activffles οὶ Denis, the chamberlain, nse no less
obscure, ior no cameral records, it they ever existed, have survived.
He receives, along with the trmsurer, a fractior· οἱ the total net sur-
plns from the rumore οἱ Βει-ιιίεγ, Witney, Wycombe, Wargrave
and Tauntou. These sums of money were not paid by the sesne manum
each year, nor did the amount received remm'n constant from year to
year. It seems quite likely therefore that they were paid on demand
into the camera at times when the fni-uls of the itiner—ant bishop's
household were low. As iu the case of John the Dean, we have no
instamus oi any disbuoeements made by him. He may however have
been authorized to make loa-ns to lomi officials in financial difficulties
