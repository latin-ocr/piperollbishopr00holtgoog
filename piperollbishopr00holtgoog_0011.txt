PREFACE

Tm? object of this book is primax-ily to transcribe and edit the text ot
the pipe roll, and secondly, to oetimate its importanoe as a source for
udministmtive history iu the early thirteenth century by attempting
to describe the administrative machinery on the Winchestez estates‘
using the text itselt as a prima-ry source, and where this ἰὼ, drawing
analogia from other estates, both lay and ecclziastieah at a slightly
later date. 1 have made no attempt therefore to comment on the
econornic aspect of the roll.

The document here tmnscfibed aud edited is one of a long seria
of 190 surviving rent rolls of the bishopric of Winchester covering,
with certain ἕψε, the period ηοῦς to 1453-54.¹ In 1890 these
reem-ds were deposited by the Eoclaeiastical Con-amisionem. part ot
whose mhivoe they form, in the Public Record Offloe. Dr. Hubert
Hal] first published a list ⁰1 the roll-5, giving a provisioual <lating to
each, in 1924.⁸ The first extant roll was transeribed and edited by the
students οἱ Dr. ΗΒΕ at the landon School o( Eoenomies and pub-
[ishad in 1903. Certain points in the introduction ase rather vague,
particularly with regard to its dating and the establishment of the
Bishop's Exchequer. The fact too that this edition was the work o(
several students explains the lack of unitoxmity in the extensions of
the text. Dr. Hau ackuowledgoe that 'the plan of such m Edition,
however systematic in its method, leuva much to be desired in
respect of the pertormahee',¹ but the thoroughness with which the
plan was carried out has been ο( great help in the nauscribing of the
present document.

Though the episoopal exchequer closely imitated the royal model
in many respects, the proeent document is not a pipe roll at all in the
Exchequer sense. It is clear too that the rna-nors it lists do not repre-
sent a complete list οἱ the bishop's tempoml possessions in 1210-11.
Paleographical evidence suggoets that the document is a munter

⁸ roll, written at the centra] exchequer and preserved as an official
z· record. Its purpose, like all documeuts of its kind in the Middle Aga,
