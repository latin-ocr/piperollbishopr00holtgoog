the contemporary lists of articles oi the vieW.¹ The 'Oourt Baron',
nn idealized court guide written for the inexperienced steward, gives
what is perhaps the best account of instances o1 brenahes of the two
assius being brought before the court.² The standard amet-cernent
for breach oi the assize regulations seems to have been sixpence.
Only in two instances do we find any variations from this amount.⁸
The offences are variously described in the roll, ‘pro assisa (or sisa)
male servata', 'pro fasso pane', and ‘pro parva cervisia'. The bishop
had the right to hold picas ‘de namin vetito' or ‘vce de marm* There
is only one reference to such a franchise on the roll.⁵

The bishopposssssed sixty knights' feet und hadrnilitary tenants?
Did he hold an honour court for thern? We have no mention of such
a court in the roll. and the evidence for the existence of honour
courts on other estates a little later in the century seems to point to
a negative answerl One vague reference in tbe Far-ribam account
might provide z slender clue—'In expensis militum, qui tenuerunt
curiam Episcopi, 25. fid! ⁷ We mnnot conclude, by linking ‘militum'
with ‘curiam Episcopi', that this is a reference to an honour court
held at Farnhzsn castle. After a detasled examinationi of various
assembliee of knights on the estates of the abbey of St. Albans, Miss
Levett concludes, ‘This passage in the '‘Gesta'' is the final proof of
the existence of a court for free tenants, but contribam no evidence
ior the existence of an honour court transacting the business peculias
to military tenants.' ¹ Levi Fox has found evidence for the existence
oi an honour court on the estates of the earldom of Leicester late in
the thirteentb century, but has to admit that ‘the evidence is dis-
appointingly fiagmentary'.⁸ The mll lists the names of those military
tenants who paid scutage in nro-11, and the bishop's marshal,
rather than the bishop himself in his honour court, seems to have
been hffly responsible for the conduct of the bisbop's military affairs.
From the limited evidence of the roll then, we cannot say whether
the bishop held an honour court or not, though we might possibly
conclude with Maiuand that, ‘. . . tbe ultimate triumph of the maner-ia]
