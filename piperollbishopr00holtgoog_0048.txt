bailifls reoeived an annual livery of 6os. rod. On the two smaller
mai-nors oi Bitterne and Wyeombe however, the bailifls' remunera-
tion only amounted to zos. and 275. mpeetively, but their dutiae on
mauors of this size would be cornparatively light⁴ Again, Williarn de
Dammamn, bailiff ot Overton. received only 52& κώ, but he rnay not
have completed a full year in office there.

A study oi the sasaxies pald within the bailiwiek oi Geoflrey de
Aclent and in that oi Taunton reveals interesting inequalities. It is
clear that at Taunton, Williarn de Sorewella, unh'ke his colleague at
Fasnham, did not combine his duties as constable with those oi
baffia. He seems to have delegated these dutiae to William de
Ferharn and William de swaphasn. who together reoeive {6 os. zod.
(presumably fios. md. each) for their services. Two 'janitors' to-
gether receive 60⁸. rod. They were no doubt responsible for keeping
the castle gate, and acted as jassoxs to any prisoners imprisoned in
the castle.¹ Geoflrey de Aclent too appears to concern himself only
with the presentation oi the accounts οἱ the five rna-nors under his
supervision, for the reeve of Wield seerns to have been paid for carry-
ing out Geoffrey's other duties. On the five manors of the group. save
Wield itsels, the reeve receives a livery οί 4os., a handsome return for
his task as bailffl’s deputy, particularly as the reeve was not nox-mally
a salaried official at all. The aflairs oi Wield itself were lett in the
hands οἱ Adam the serjeant. Such an administrative arrangement,
though quite exceptional, must have suited local convenience.

The reeve¹ of all the manvi-iai officials, is the one to invite rnost
speculation. He is the rnost important rnan on the mai-ior, the chosen
leader oi the villein community, and yet normally receives no wage:
he is supposedly illiterate, and yet is responsible for the drawing up
of a most detailed account. Being ⁰1 a lower socia! stratum than the
bailiff, the reeve must uniortunately remain as nothing more than a
name. We do not know how the reeve was appointed on the Win-
chaeter estates. Walter oi Henley urges that he be elected by the
whole villein community.¹ We must beware however οἱ attributing
a unisorm system οὶ appointment on all the bishop's mauors, where
perhaps no unisonnity existed.¹

After examining the manerias reem-ds of several estates, mostly of
the early fuurteenth oentury, Mn Bennett is able to concludet ¹¹... by
the lourteenth century at least. the reeve was often as permanent an
