The term is sufficiently vague however to he applied equally well to
any number oi taults committed by the tit-hings whilst tulfilling
obligations tur wider tha-n the cases recorded on the roll would
suggest. Their main responsibility was the pursuit οὶ fugitives) and
the detentioni ot eriminal members oi their tithing.

Suit oi court, owed as a customary due by viuein tenants, was
doubtlss looked upon ὕ a heavy burden and must have meant a loss
οἱ valuable time to those who owed it. Members οἱ tithings wne
willing to pay quite large fines for exemption horn attending the
view.¹ This question of composition is closely linked with the develop-
ment of the payment of tithing penny. In origin tithing penny was
paid to secure exemption {rom personal attendanee at the vieW.⁸
Later it developed into a head tax payzble by every tithing member
and the exemption it originally secui-ed wus then only to be gained
by the payment of an additional sum seemingly sured by cmtom.
Th'ss development might partly explain the large sums οἱ money
pald by tithings for unspecified reasons.¹ The simplest explanation
οἱ them is that they represent the wntractions oi separate items in
the bailifl’s account made by the clerk as he copied them outo the
rou, either because they were wmmonplaee, or because he was aware
that the amount-s received were alone of importance to whoever
might inspect the roll, Such sum are probably the fusion into one
entry οὶ payments oi tithing penny and exemption fines.

At Taunton‘ we find this unusual entry: ‘De 53. de thedinga
Priori: Tantonie pm sirnili’ (i.e. conoealxnent). Are we to infer that at
thia date the clergy, at least in the aren around Taunton, were not

twelve months, but the office, like that of the xeeve, was one οἱ
heavy responsibility, and one which the villein would be loath to
accept. Again, there seems to have been some tendency to keep the
office in the hands of the more wealthy men ot the group, says
Matris! though suitable leaders for the grnups were osten difficult to
find. Would it not be possible therefore that the men ot the tithing
at Tauntun, experieneing just this difficulty, §ought to place re-
sponsibility in the hands ot the Prior without his neoessarily being
a member os the group himself?
