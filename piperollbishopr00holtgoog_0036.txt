of those &anchises which direetly gave rise to a cash profit in the
torm of amercements. Through lack ο( any contemporary evidence
it might be unwise to argue from the later evidence that the bishop
puffied ΗΕ own gallows, and the antecedent right oi passing
capital sentence upon his tenants tried in his own σπι-15 on major
crimina] dim-ges normally regarded as pleas οἱ the Crown. But by
royol chartei*¹ in 1208 Peter des Roches had been granted the right
to ‘inffangenthies' and ‘utfangenthiest amounting to a right to try nl]
enses ⁰1 theft and robbery, ielouies punishable by death. and greatly
favour-ed as he was, as a royalist supportet throughout the troubled
years οἱ John's later reign, the bishop might asily have had his own

The view of trankpledge was a common franchise, and on the
Winchester estates, a profitable one. Statistim cornpiled imm the
roll, cover-ing some of the larger rnanorr»,¹ show that in several cases
the profits accruing (rom the bi-annual view amounted approxi-
mately to one fifth! and oue quater· of the tota-l revenue of the
bishop's conns* At Bishop's Waltham and Bishopstoke the propor-
tion was almost one third. These are only approximate figures aud

indication of the finnncial importante οἱ the franchise. The right to
hold the view had originally been the prerogative of the shen'fl in his

the private view was not exercised without some definite recognition
(mually in the torm of a money payrneut made 1ο the sheriff) of its
original character as a regality! She adds however that the view was
held by the greater lords in complete independence of the sherffl.
This seems to have been the case on the Winchoster estates. We have
no record that the sheriffs of the enunties in which the estam lay
received any share οἱ the profits οἱ the view, save at Taunton. where
