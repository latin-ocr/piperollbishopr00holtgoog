as early as 1221 he had been appointed with three others as justice oi

The bishop's knights form the second ot our three very asbi-
trarily divided groups. Experts in finanoe,¹ they may also have had
dutiffl of a legal nature, and at least one of the bishop's knights was
responsible for holding 3 hundred court on the manor of Hambledon!
Maurice de Turvilla is probably the most active and certainly the
most prominent 01 the knights. Joint custodian, with William de
Falaise, of winchester Castle in 1215.‘ he acted as the representative
ο( Peter des Roches in the latter's suit against the Prior of Wiurhoeter
znd Richard de Westwood, late in 1214· He was prominent as a
county coroner ot Glouoestershire, z post he held until 1225,’1 and as
an itiner-ant justice of Wiltshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Hamp-

as constable oi the Tower o( Laneion„ Early in the following reign
he is employed by the kingand is described as 'senescallus noster¹.¹⁴

We may tum now to the officials of our third and last group, those
most direetly concerned with the organization οἱ the manorial v
eoonomy. The bishop's estate steward stood at the apex oi 3 pyra-
mid of manci-iai executive officers, the wide base of which was
tonned by the loca] exeeutive—roeve. hayward and beadle. As on
