Traditionally, the manor and hundred oourts met at three-weekly
intes-vals, and though we have no indication that this was the case
on the Winchoster estates, there is nothing to suggest anything tu
the contrary. Indeed, the lact that the maner cour-ts on the estates
of the abbeys of Ramsey¹ and Crowland¹ met only twioe cath year
may be regarded as entirely exoeptional. We should be justified in
assuming that no formal summons to attend was issued, save on the
occasion of the bi-annual plenary sessions ot the hundred court,
when it was usual to give from eight to fineen days' not-iae.⁴ At East
Woodhay William de Hume was amereed twelve penoe. 'pro sum-
monitio non iaetast‘ We do not know how offences were presented

states that this was part oi the hayward’s duty, ’. . . and he (i.e. the
hayward) ought to make attachinents and appmvements ssaithiully,
and make the delivery by pledge before the provost, and deliver them

By the end oi the century the bishop claimed the right to hold
the view oi hankpledge, the assius οὶ Bread and Ale, to have his
own gallows, and to hear plens 'de narnio vetito’ on at least seven ⁰1
his mauors.⁷ On the mauor of Taunton‘ he claimed the additional
right to have the chattels us any of his tenants convicted of a ielony
in a royal court⁴ 01 these legal fianchises we ean only find positive
evidence from the roll that the bishop, in 1210, was exercising the
right to hold the view ot liankpledge, the assizes oi Bread and Ale,
and the hearing of pleas 'de narnio vetito'. From a document pri-
marily conoemed with finanoial matters we can expect to hear only
