oentral exchequer, or, if the audit were an itinemnt oue, upon their
arrival at the manor in question. le account theu passed through a
final staff, and the form amended by the auditors was carenilly
copied, along with the other maneria] accounts. on to a single roll¹
known technieally as the counter·rol.l,¹ a document kept ior official
purposes. Though no maneria-l oompotus rolls or views of account
survive for the Winehoeter mauors at this early date, we have no
reason to suppose that procedure there diflered in any way {rom the
general procedure described.

Paleographical evidence indicates that the present document is a
counter-roll. The extreme neatness ot the document, the careful
avoidanoe of mistakas, and the correction ,ot such mistakes as there
are by erasure, not by deletion, give the impression that the roll is a
{air copy. Iu several cases the scribe makes what are obviously
eri-ms in copying tota-Is entered at the end of a section, and yet
ari-iva at a correct final total, an impossibility had he been calculat-
ing hom his own figures. The accounts are enrolled from one mern-
brane to the next, and a varying number oi accounts is entered on
each membrano. The manner in which the ioot ot each membrane
tapers to a blunt end clearly indicates that the document is a
counter-roll, to be preserved as an official source ot reierenoe. The
fact that the rull is the work ot a single copyist at the bishop’s ex-
chequer explains the haphazard euml-ment oi the accounts. They
were doubtless copied as they came to hand, which may or may not
have corresponded to the order in which they were presented. What-
ever the case, the accounts were not entered aomrding to any
recognizable system of classification.

Normally. the accounts ase divided into two main sections, the
cash account, and the grain and stud< account. Following what
seems to have been a general pmctiee. the scribes on the manors ot
the abbey oi Bec in Englaud entered the former on the face, and the
latter on the dorse οἱ a membmne,¹ This may have been the case
with the amount rolls of the Winchester lands. The cash account is
further subdivided into Receipts and Expenditure, and ends by
striking a net balance between the two. The structure oi an account
is best illustrated in the form of a table, though little that is new can
be added to Dr* Hall's comprehensive table.¹
