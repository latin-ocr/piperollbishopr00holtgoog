Α section dealing with the problem ot dating the Winuhoeter rolls
might seem superfluous in view oi the exhaustive work done by Dr,
Hubert Hau and Sir Williasn Beveridge¹ on this subject, but it will be
worthwhile briefly to correct any erroneorus irnpressions arising from
Dr. Hall's explanations of the dating in his Introduction to the
1208-9 roll! Hau, citing evidence from the public records,¹ gives the
impr-ssimi that Peter des Roches enjoyed au the profits oi the see
before Michaelsnas 1205 ‘in virtue οἱ ruys-l mandates: This is mis-
leading.⁴ On 21 September ¹2⁰4 King John by letters patent granted
to Peter the epimopal rights οἱ ecclesiastica patronege which had
lapsed tc the Crown sade vacante, while on ²9 August 1205 the
custodiam of the see were ordered by letters close to pay off the
debts of the bishop-elect from the stoek, chattels, grain and produce
oi the bishopric of Winchester. cleasly, although Peter may have
derived great advantage irum these gmnts' the tempoxalities οἰ the
see were still under the Crown's control late in August 1205. But
the Exchequer pipe roll οἱ 7 John (to Miehaelmas 1²⁰5) only shows
an ewount by the royal custodiaris ior the period §rom 11 September
1²⁰4 (when Bishop Godirey de Lucy died) tc 24 June ¹²05· and no
other accmmt of the custodiam appare on the next pipe rous. In
their account the custodimus show the eompasstively small item οἱ
ζῐοο granted to ‘the elect of Winchester' de praecito! Althcugh Peter
dns Roth& was not inv-stad with the tmpomsitias as bishop until
24 March 1206,ι it seems that, acting on some unrecorded order οἱ
the King, the custodiens carried out his benevolent intention of
29 August 1²⁰5 by accounting to the bishop and not to the Exchequer
ior the nine months after ²4 June 1²⁰5- It is just possible that the
rever-lues ior the whole οι· part of this period were amounted for in
the royal camera, but there are no solid grounds ior this hypothesis.

Whatever the destination of the episcopal revenues between June
1205 uni March 1206, Hau’s dating οἰ the bishop's pipe rous is
correct. Peter was consecrated on 25 September 1²⁰5 and technic-
ally his first pontifical year ended on 24 September 1206. But as Sir
William Beveridge says, 'For administration of the temperantias.
