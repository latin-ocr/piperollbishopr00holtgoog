as indicative οἱ unfree status,¹ included the mei-chet fine. leirwite
and hei-iot. whilst instauoes oi villeins paying leixwite, a fine (σι’
lapses oi moi-al conduct, were rare on the bishop's mauors,¹ the
merchet oi· marriage fine occurs more frequently, being paid even by
the widows οἱ villein tenants on their re-marrying. Both Miss Leven
and Robo see the payment of merchet as a registi-atim see, rather
than as a sign of gross social inequality.⁸ mss Levett has concluded
that the amount to be paid depended upon the prosperity of the
manor as a whole. On the Winchester estates it would seem to depend
rather upon the wealth of the individual eonoerned. Fax from being
fixed by manorial custom, the amount varies not only from maner to
maner, but fluetuntes even within a single maner. We may find in-
slanoes of the payment οἱ heriot‘ both in cash,¹⁵ and in kind* Though
payrnent in kind stin persisted, and was stul quite nonu-uon, it was
obviously becoming more advantageous to all conca-ned that it
should be commuted to a fixed cash payment. On many οἱ the
bishop's mannis this was already taldng place. Finally, fines for the
transierenoe of land whatever the cause—as the result of a bequest,
an exchange or sale—were paid during the sasima of the halis-note.
In his monograph on Famhzsn, Robo concludes that though the fine
is not a heavy one, ‘it is possible that custom, which was all powerful,
fixed {01- ever the fines paid for every piece οἱ land. The asnounss vaxy
widely for the sesne aerea-ge oi land! ⁷ Unfortunately we cannot say,
from the limited evidence of the mil, how fas this was applicable to
the bishop's &tates as a whole. We may only note that the amount of
the fines vari& from as little as sixpenoe to as munh as five marks.
Professor Ault in his discussion of the murts on the estates oi Rasn-
sey Abbey‘ has mentioned a possible distinction between transies oi
