customary court are anachronistie, and says? ‘lt may well be
doubted whether arry one of these three ter-ms was in common use
even at the end οὶ the thirteenth century'.¹ He goes so far as to prove
conclusively that hundred court and halimote were but two δρα-,Ε
οἱ the same com, the halimote. and Vinogxadofl arrived inde-
pendently at similar conclusione* The haphazard way in which
the prosus from the bishop¹s eourts are entered on the roll seems to
support such conclusionis. If the two murts did not exist as corn-
pletely separate institutions, the need ior grouping the fines md
ameroements according to the oourts in which they were levied
would not arise. We cannot determine the socia] status 01 the tenants
who are named as paying ameroements into the bishop's oourts,
though by far the greater majority of thern, trom the nature οὶ the
finos they pay, must obviously have been villein tenants. But even if
this were otherwise, it is extremely unlikely that we should be able
to distinguish between the bishop's hundred aud maner courts by
asguing the {ree status of the suitms to the one, and the uniree
status of the suitors to the other. As Vinogradofi says, ‘As there was
but one halimot and not two, both classes had to meet and to act
ooueunently in it.¹ ⁵ Only at a much later date ean Mis Levett
describe the fimetions oi a court held by the Abbot of St. Albans
speeificmy tor his free tenants.⁴ In the first demde of the thirteenth
century, the ten-n ‘libera curia', a term not round in the pipe roll,
will generally mean little more than a court to which a lord has an
exclusive right rather than a court of free cenante· Iu this period
one must think in ternis ot the abstrutt, in tenus ol jurisdictions
rather than in the more concrete terrns ot actual court&

The foundation upon which the whole legal structure of the
bishop's estates rested lay in the halimote, and the extent ot its
jurisdiction cari best be judged by the wide variety of businss eon-
ducted there. Here the customary law οἱ the manor was defined and
enioreed. The minor manorial officials responsible ior the smooth
and efficient running of the agrarian lite οί the community were
elected in the manor court, transfers of land held in villeinage were
witnessed there, her-iot and rnen-,het finae were exaetod. and any
trespass upon the lord’s property was punished there. In raet. all
quoetions wnoerning the relationships between the bishop and the
maneria] eommunity were brought into the halimote ior settlement.
