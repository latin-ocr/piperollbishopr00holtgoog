rwsonable to assume that any lord would not lightly refuso the eon-

of the thirteenth century, the same reeve remam in offioe for several
years in succfflsion⁴ The permanence of the meve in office on the

The reeve on the Winehoeter mauors was no noviee whatever the
ease on the Ely estates-

ι’ More closely connected with the work performed on the manor-
than either the bailifl or stewasd, the reevae' dutiae were both heavy
and all-embracing. To select but a few items from what would be an
almost endlsss and tedious catalogue oi his funetions: he was
charged with the collection oi the rents due to the bishop from the
manor, with the muection oi the perquisites οἱ the bishop's manorial
murts. with the payrnent of wag& due both in caslr andin kind, with
the general supervision of the tanning operations, ploughing, sowing,
hasvesting, thraehing, with the ensuring of a suffioiently numerous
md healthy livmtock, and finally with the supervision of repairs to
rnills¹ manos house, farm implements, and all manner of building
operationis. Iu return he received an acquittanoe of rent, usually of
5s. about this time, and certain other privileges. including mi some
manors a small grain allowanoe, and on most mauors a floece of wool.
The remuneratior: for such heavy duties seems small, but the reevoe
doubtlees found other ways and means οἱ receuping themselvess.¹

In conclusion, some briei mention must be made of the hayward
and beadle, the τῶνδ’ colleagues on the manor. We lmow nothing of
their dutioe from the roll, but must assume that their activities
resembled rather closely those oi their equals on the Ely estates!
deifionany, as his name suggests, the haywasd was mponsible ior
gua-rding the bishop's erops, and for maintaining the hedges and
ditches protocting them from sti-ay cattle which it was his duty to
impound. The anonymous ‘Senesehaueie' informs us that it was his
duty to present 1111 offenders against the customary law oi the manor
before the memorial court.s The beadlae' elutius were oi a police
