lrish campaign in the Summer ot 1210, he was apparently praem in

representativeot the bishop.¹ He was still in episoopal service in 1227,
when he is described ns 'senescallus P. Wintoniensis Episcopi'.¹
During the 123o's he is witru& to several charters eoncerned with
various pascels οὶ land granted to the prim-y of Selborne,⁸ and even
witam one such grant between 1240 and 1250! Having acquired
professi->nal training and sound practica! experiente in astate
management. it was probably a simple matter for the estate steward
to pass fiorn private into royal service, either as sheriff or itinerant
justice, and by 1230 Waeelin's position was greatly improved. For
two years, between October 1232 and October 1234, he was sherifl
of Hampshire, during which tirne he was also appointed, during
pleasure, custodian of Porehaeter and Winehoeter Castles! It is
doubtful if at this tin-ie Wacelin was still in the bishop's service,
though he att-ets three episcopal char-teis! between Μυσὴ 1234 and
June 1238.

Α study οἱ the roll revmls that a second person, and to a laser
extent a third, were shnring the elutis of steward, an arrangement
common on ecelesiastica] and lay estates alike throughout the thir-
teenth century?¹ Of this triumvir-ate at the head oi the minister-iai
hiemehy Roget Waeelin was undoubtedly the most important. His
‘assistant-52 as we might call them rur want of a better word, are
John the Dean, and Stephen the clerk. As we have seen, the activities
οἱ John the Dean lie in quite a diflerent direction} He appears how-
ever (ο be the official oeoeiver of produce, including large quantities
oi nats, corn, salt, eggS, cheese and hensa but not wool, sent to
Wolvoeey imm rna-nors ns neas as Cfflwley and as distant as Taunton,
commodities sent to provision the bishop's midenee rather than tor
marketjngl Stephen the clerk on the other hand is found acting in a
capadty similar to that ot the 'senmallus hospicii' of a later date* In
this connection it is interesting to note that already in the summer of
121⁰ his name is linked with that ot Roger Waeelin as the bishop's
representative in the royal army in Ireland.¹⁰ though he was in the
service οἱ the bishops οὶ Winehester at least as early as ¹¹99-¹¹ Being
