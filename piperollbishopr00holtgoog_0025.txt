by the bishops οἱ Winchaeter οἱ the model provided by the royal
exchequer, with whid: they were so familiar. 05 the actual audit we
lmow nothing. We may asem-ne that the sessions lasted from a week
to ten days. It is obvious that the bishop's two chiei financial
officials. John the Dean, his treasurer, and Denis, his chamberlain,
would be present to receive the eash sui-plus οἱ each manor, as would
the maneria] stewasd, acting, if we ase to believe the author οί the
‘Seneschaueiez iu a subordinate capacity to the auditori-„¹ The
bishop's marshal may have acted in a dua] capacity, both as an
acommtant lox the scutages levied on the bishop's milita-ty tenants,
and as one of a small body of barons of the bishop's exchequer. He
may too have been keeper oi the writs and tallias, if his duties were
at all similar to those oi his namesake in the royal exchequer. As we
have seen? the bishop's knights were responsible ior taking the view

In most oeses each amount was presented jointly by the baslifl
and reeve.¹ Who then was ultimately responsible for the atcumy of
the account, bailifl or reeve? The author of the ¹Seneschaucie'
declares that, ’. . . it is not right that the provost (i.e. reeve). who is
the lord's chattel, and who reasonably must know much less than the
bajlifl shouldbe punished or answer tor the doings οἱ the bailia . . .’.“
But Drew⁴ has shown that ou the estates οἱ St. Swithun's Priory, it
was the reeve rather than the bailifl who bore complete responsi-
bility. He goes ou to argue that this explains the use οἱ the singulas
fomis ‘debetz ‘solvan and ‘quietus est', aster the amount has begua
by using the plural form ‘reddunt compotum'.⁸ This is undoubtedly
the case in the present document. According to the anonymous
‘Husbandry', the socom-itant ought to render his account on cath,⁸
