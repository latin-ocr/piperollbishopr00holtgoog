that at that time Wolvesey Castle was the seat of the bishop's ex-
chequer and the adrninislmtive centre oi his astatus, We have iound
no evidence of diis earlier than August η59.1 Hubert Hall, apparently
basing his assumpt-iens on the later evidence, assei-ts that the epis-
copal exchequer was held at Wolvwey in the early thirteenssi
century.¹ In his introduction to the izos-9 roll,⁸ citing evidenoe
from ssie text, but without giving precise references, he asseris:
¹Moreover, we have notices in the text itself of seesions of this
episcopal exchequer (i.e. at Wolvesey) at which the bishop prosided
on certain occasions in person, whilst adjonmments imm term tu
term are recorded in the precise iorni oi the King's Courts at West-
minster! Such assertions are unfounded. After carenilly studying the
text, and particularly the reiereuoes given by Hali in liis index to
Wolvesey. we can find neither any mention οἱ the 'adjoumments'
referred to, nor any evidence that the bishop proeided over the ex-
chequer, and indeed it would be rnore likely, in view of his politica]
activitiee, that the bishop would entrust such matteis to the dis‹
ctetion oi liis steward and treasurer. In both the ηαδ-9 roll, and the
1210-11 roll¹ Wolvosey emergas as little rnore than an episcopal
msidenue ather than as a place oi audit and account. The evidence
ui the present roll, and in the absence of externa-l evidence it cannot
be ignored, however tenuous, seems to indicate that the exchequer
was held at Southwark.

In the Southwark account we find the following enti-ies:

‘In expensis Roberti de Hotot venientis ad scaccarium ad fatum
Sancti Michaelis per 6 dies, 6⁵. mais,⁴ and ‘In expensis Roberti de
Hotot venientis ad scaccarium ad iustum Sancti Michaelis per 3 dies,
4³. 11d.',¹ and ‘In expensis Roberti de Hutut venientis ad scaccarium
ad festum Sancti Hiuan'i, ὃς. pei· 5 diest·

ΑΞ we have men, our roll, written at the exchequer for official
pul-pm, is a fair copy of the amount roll οὶ each manor, written
loca-ny, and we may assume that these entriae were originally written
at Southwark. Bearing this in mind, it is significant that the scribe
writes ‘venientis' and not ‘euntis'. Apart horn the Southwark
account the word ‘scaccarium' appears only once,⁷ and (rom the
context is taken to mean a place of audit and account rather than a
place of depos-it. a treasury: and in any mse, the fact that Robert de
