mouymous ‘Seuescheueie'.¹ Master Robert Basset is described as
'seu-schal of the bishop οἱ Winchester' in a charter probably dated
between 1205 and 1210‚¹ but the pipe roll shows that Roget Waoelin
was very active in the dutiae οἱ stewardship iu this year and may
already have sueeeeded to the offioe iu which he appears, many years
later. iu 1227.¹

Stenton is able to assert that in the twelfth century, though the
senescallus is ‘his lord's executive officerwithin the honour at large. . .
the pmurnption is that a lord will tmisact his legal businsss in per-

beginning to take prime place in his aetivities. ⁰ By the end 01 the
century the steward’ s legal work had become almost all- -absorbing,
until more and ruore of his economic dutioe were delegated to sub-
ordinatas, as was the case ou the estates οἱ the abbey οὶ St. Albans

pufflibly over an oeeasioual hundred court! The roll throws little or
no light on Roger Wacelin's judicia] activities. Thnugh we can traee
the mauors he visited during the year, we are unable to discover the
object of his visits, which may have been ones of roufine inspeetion
and supervision. The fact that he visits all nine of the bishop's
hundredal mmmm· and many of the larger mauors in 'foreign'
hundret-1⁵¹⁰ might suggest that hewas in fut holding oourts leet there.
Evidenoe oi two separate visits during the year to each hundredal
maner, save Wargrave and Bishop's Sutlon, streugthens this
hypothesis.

Though Roger Waeelin mey not have enjoyed a socia-l position
