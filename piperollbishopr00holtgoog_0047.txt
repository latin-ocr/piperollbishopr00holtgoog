more closely connected with the bishop's household than either
Waoelin or John the Dean, Stephen seez-ns to have been the bishop's
purveyor on quite a large scale—dealing with 29.130 dried herrings,
delivered to him at Faseham to be handed over to the bisbop’s took?
118 ffitehoe os bacon? 27 obeesss, and the carmes οἱ two oxen at
Waltham? and 1⁰4 ffitches ot bacon and 70 nens at Southwark.¹ to
mention but a few instarem Unlike his two eolleaguss, Stephen
seems to have journeyed in the bishop's retinue and to have pro-

¹ The bailifi held an inter-mediate position in the hieru-chy,

reeves and over the actual §unaing of the menois, along with that οὶ
presiding over maner and hundred court, as are described by his
contemporaries⁴ On the Winchester estet& the maner rather than
the bailiwiek appears to have been the bailifls' unit of administration.
Each of the bishop's larger manens hed their own baffifl. Several of
the smaller manors however were grouped together under the super-
vision of a single hasim.- The torrnztion of such larger unit-5 was not
an uncommon fezture oi tbirteenth- end early ffourteenth-oentury
