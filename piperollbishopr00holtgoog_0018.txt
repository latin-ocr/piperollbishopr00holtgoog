investitum is the most important date and the oue from which as n
mle the accounts begin! ¹ The Winehaeter serssxs iollow the system
of dating used for number-ing the pipe rolls of the royal Exchequff,
and number their rolls acuording to the number oi the episcopal yar
iu which the Michaelmas acoount fell. This being so, almough the
first year oi Peter's episcopam would not end until 24 March 1207,
the first Michaelmas to fau within that period would be Michaelrnas
1206 and this would determine the end οἱ the fust period of aecount.
This componas to Hau's conclusion that the rol-l sor the ‘fourth
year' was for the year Michaelmas xzoss-Mjchaelmas 1209 ; and
establishes that the present roll is for the year 1210-11. The evi-
dence tor dating the present roll is scanty but sufficient. The only
dating label it bars are the words 'Annus VI' written on the tangue
οὶ the dorse oi the last membrane. We are denied the possibility ot
mztching the arrents upon it with the debits of 1209-10, or the
debit-5 of this roll with the ari-urs οἰ 1211-12, ior the ηας-ιο roll is
missing, and the 1211-12 ml] ‘unfit (01- production'.¹ Refer-enm on
the roll to externa] events aie pmctitassy confined to indications of
King John's moveri-ienis: provisioni was made ior him at Winehffiter

(p. 85), at Gillingharn (p. 92) at Freemantle on 6 October and at
Taunton before ffichaelmzs. 'l'he royal itineraxy does not exclude
1210 or 1211 for any of these data: but it could onlybe in 1211 that
the King needed provision from the maner oi Downton on 6 Feb-
ruary (p. 35) when he was ou the way from elai-endon to Downton}

We may now consider the broader quatiens of where, how and
why the rou was written. lt is well lmown that whatever procedure
was followed in taking the view and audit on an estate, its written
accounts usually passed through three distinet phasee! In the middle
οἱ the finanum year, or whenever the view was held, the 'visus
compoti', a detailed record οἰ income and expenditure to date, was
drawn up for examinatior* and oon-ecn'on by those taking the view.
At the audit at the end of the financial year the ‘compotus' roll of
each maner—based on the 'visus compoti'. hut stripped very largely
of its minute details—was presented before the auditore at the
