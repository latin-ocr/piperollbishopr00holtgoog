ehamber ‘per manum Dionisii camemii'ff As the bisbop's rep-
resentative Denis may have authorized certain exhaordinary ex-
penditure, as at Farnham, where the account-,ing reeve justifies the
spending oi ⁵⁵- nd. on entertaining Master Einierus by noting that
it was spent ‘per Dionisiurn casnerafium'.¹ His expensas are paid tor
taking two views at Farnham,¹ and on the Sunday before the Puri-
fioation (the date. J anuary 3ο, suggests that he was holding a view)
he is at Bitteme for two days.⁴

Such theu was the bisbop's finaneial system. Iis main {eatur-s
were a local view οἱ wcount held in February, or thereabouts, and a
regular audit held centrally at Michaelnias each year, probably at
Southwark. To some degree the tenu-a] exchequer, like the bishop's
hundred murts, and the grouping of his mauors into the administra-
tive unit, the bailiwiek, helped to bind together the component parts
oi the bishop's estates. It seems reasonable to assert that the bishop
used such ol his clerks and the laymen 01 his staff as were at hand to
hold the view and audit. The bishop’s finaneial system had been too
much influeneed by the familiar royal model to find any use for the
travelling auditor. The haphazatd payrnent ot widely varying sums
nt money into the episcopal camera suggests that carneral finds
were replenished' like the royal chamber, troni time to time by direct
in-payments as the need arnse.

On the Winchoeter estates the bishop exereised a jurisdiction
which was fianchisa] and maneria-l, the one as a result of the delega-
tion οἱ regalien rights by the erown, and the other xesult'mg (rom the
pomoni ot menois and tenants. We cannot go iar beyond this in
establishing distinctions between the bishop's murts as separate
institutione. 'l'heoretically the bishop held three types oi oourts on
his astatus. Thmugh his bailifls he exercised a domanial jurisdictioni
in the customary court or halimote; as lord over his vassals, he held
a hundred court to which both his military and bis other free tenants
owed suit 3 and, finally, a lai-annual court leet, a crimina-l court where
the bishop was entitled to hold such eriminal plens as were not still
legarded as pleas of the Crown. On most estates at this tinne such
diflerentiation had not pmgraesed far, and was only tu reach its
cuhnination in the Quo Warranto prooeedinge of Edward Ι.ι Mait-
