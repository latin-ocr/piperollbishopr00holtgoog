muster-red in the hundred court. On the Winchester estat& it seems
unneeessary to make this distinction, 33 it was not impossible that
in pacfice the two courts were {used into one.

The bishop's hundred coum were not held at any oeutral plane
within the hundred and the roll makes it obvious that each sep-uate
manor, whether hundreda] or not, had ils own hundred court. The
bishop possaesed the hundredal manors of Bishop’s Walffimn.¹
Bishop's Ξιιτταῐι,1 Meonchurch‚¹ an’ehssm,⁴ Downton,⁶ 0verton,‘
Wugmvey Famlmn! and Taunton.¹ along with the libeni& of
Alastordrffl and Bentley. ”Turningforamomeut lo the laterevidenoe
of the court rolls we find that even on mauors in loreign hundreds
the bishop's tenants were exemp( from attendanoe at a ‘foreign'
lord’s hundred court, and paid suit to the hundred court held by the
bishop on his own manor. According to the ten-ns οἱ a royal charter
of 120811 the bishop was perfectly within his rights in doing so. As
early 33 1236 we find that the tenants οἱ the bishop's mauors oi
Bitterne, Fawley and Ower owed suit to the hundred murt ol
Bishop's Waltham, even though Bitteme was ln the foreign hundred
οἱ Mainsbridge, and Fawley within the hundred of that name, a
hundred held by the Prior and eonvent of St. Swithun's.¹¹ Further-
more. the umes oi those three rnanors actually paid suit to lhe
hishop’s hundred wurt held at Bitterne, as Bishop's Walthasn was
too distant.¹¹ The fact that Bria-n, a tenant of Fawley, initiales, but
§alls to prosecute, a suit against Walter the clerk in the hundred
court of Bitterne, confir-ms that the arrangement described existed
as early 33 1210. ¹⁵ Attendanoe at any court meant theoretically one's
proeenee within the four walls ol the manor house, or wherever the
oouxt was held. Onoe there one was not allowed to leave until fonn-
dle dismissed, under threat of inem-ing 3 fine for contempt oi
court. 'pro sursisa'. But the perfommuoe ol suit οὶ court meant much
more than presenting oneself at each sessim, it implied a liability to
serve on 3 jury if elected to do so. It is not surprising then to find
