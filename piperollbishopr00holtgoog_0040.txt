to discover such murts (Le. honour oourts) will make us suspect that
they never were very corrunon'.¹

Thmugh the system οἱ his murts, we see the bislwp maintaining
public order and eninr-:ing the socia] and eoonomic rights o( a lord

that the Compotm Roll of ¹2⁰9 enablae us to reconstruct the con—

dence οἱ what is primarily a financial document must take into
account two important considerations. Facts of purely legal interest,
which might find their way into a court roll, are excluded from an
account roll as irrelevant to its main purpose. Thus questions regard-

IV. Tm! Bxsnor's Execurwss

We have nlready seen something ol the officials responsible ior the
organization of finanoial and legal eflairs on the bishop's estat-32 but
what officials were responsible for the organization ol the man-:trial
wamy: who euntrolled and supervised the labour force upon them,
md what clo we know 01 the functions ol the bishop's own household
officials? It is impossible to group the officials on the Winchesver
estates according to 'type' or ‘funetionfl so varied are their activitioe,
but we may (rather arbitres-ily, it is true) divide thern into three
groups, household officials, militasy tenants and manorial officials.

Like most tweltth century baronia] households, the bishop had a
household steward, chamberlain, constable and marshal, though by
this time constable and marshal had undertaken dutiae of se wide a
nature that they cannot properly be described as household officia-Is
