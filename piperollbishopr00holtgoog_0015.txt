sense. When the sewn membranes were mlled trem head to foot to
form the ‘rotulus’, the ieet were leit exposed, making reterenee to the
account ot any one manor both speedy ud simple.

Attachod to the lower right-hand margin oi the taoe ot mem-
bane 9 is a pieee of parchment δὲ inches wide and 7} inchae hung¹
bearing an account headed 'Alresiordz De Burgo', and written in the
same neat hand as the rest oi the document. There are two unruled
margins approximately a quar-ter of an inch wide. This account is
almost identieal with that entered on the dorse of the last membrane
under the heading ‘Forum de Alraetord'. The main diflerence
between the two is a memorandum oi outstanding debts which
occurs in the latter account. The heading ‘Forum de Alraeiord' is
deleted by a single stroke which is continued down both marginS.
and the whole account seems to bave been copied σι] to the roll in
ΕῘΪΟΓ.

The gene-m] condition of the manuscript is excellent, but the
dorse of the ieet oi membres-res 2 ancl 9 are badly discolouxed. The
dorse ot the feet of membran& 4 and 7 are well rubbed, making
transm-iption difficult. and in places impossible. The root oi mern-
bane 10 is very badly mutilated. A large jagged piene. extending into
much ot the text, has been completely torn away, and the {out oi the
membrane is missing. The margins oi the document are for the most
part iutact. The right-hand margin oi the face oi membr-ane 2 is torn
away from hali-way down the membrane to the tout. Thus. on the
(ace, the heudings oi the various sections ot the account are missing,
whilst on the dorse part of the text itself is missing. The right<hand
margin oi the tuoe oi membrane 5 is also hayed, but the iraying does
not extend into the text. The headings oi the sections oi the accounts,
entered in the left-hand margins. are written in the normal cursive
hand. whilst the names oi the manors are written in the text in large
capitals. The tides ot many ot the manorsshare the same line asthe
last enfly ot the preceding account and are sometimes even written
in the margin itseli, as in the casani Bitteme. Farnham. and Harwell.

The general appearance nithe manuscript is one οί extreme neat-
ness. In several places the ink from the tace has seeped through the
parchment to disfigure the writing on the dorse. There are few
erasures, and the document is written throughout in the same hand¹
save tor two brief marginal notes. The scribe's cursive hand is tor
the most part easily readable. Individua] letters are clear aud me
iully ior-med, and are dammi-istic oi the period. The scribe is not
aecustomed to dotting his letter Ὗ, save where two such letters
occur together in a word when he will stroke both iaintly. He freely
uses the twelith century 's' with the serii, and the early thirteenth
century ‘s' with the long curving dnwnstmke. but without the serii.
