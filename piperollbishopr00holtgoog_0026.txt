ud in the late thirteenth century an oath in French was actually
administered to the bishop's steward. The reeves were accountable at
the exchequer ior the money income imm au sources—for the per-
quisitas οἱ the memorial court, as well as for all customary dues aud
rents, except scutage. It is quite likely that doubtful points in an
acoount would be resolves] by reference to a jury οἱ presentment,
though there are no speeifie references to such in the roll.

Having praeuted his account, and justified all extraordinary
expensos by producing tames or writs of authorizafion, the reeve
pald the uet balance and received, if he were wise, a formal acquit-
tanoe from the bishop's toeasurer. On only som· mauors, Bitteme,
Farnham, Bentley aud Meonchurch, and in the Winchester account
itseli, do the reeves fail to pay the whole balance. Their debts will
{on-n the first item οἱ the accounts of these rna-nors at the end οἱ the
next financial year. Unpajd debis are carried forwasd θοι-η year to
year so that a reeve often inherited the debr-s οἱ his predecessor. The
reove of Wycornbe owed two marks a debt inem-md by R. de
Twirigge 'de tempore Ricaxdi Morel' ¹ We cannot ascertain exactly
how old the debt was and the two marks were not pald· m 1211. The
Alresiord account reoonss a whole list οἱ out-standing debts,¹ begin-
ning optimistically enough with: ‘Et quietus est de hoc asmo.¹ But
Osbert the reeve and Robert the berebrettus owe §14 js. ma.—
'unde gro 9s. 711. sunt de remgio temporis Hem-ici la Martre'. Again
we do not know how old the debt was, but it was at least two years
old² and rnay have been considerably older for the reeve of Alresford
claims that the debt was incurred ‘ante tempus Henrici la Martre',
from which we may inter that a mmm-ias official may not have been
held responsible tor the debis of any but his immediate predecessor.
There are fflmdry other debes, aud the two officials fine with the
bishop and are fortunate enough to be quit by the bishop’s writ-
Sums recorded in the roll therefore as debts do not necessarily indi-
cate inefficient management on the part οἱ the aewuntantsl It was
possible to take legalaction against defaultingoffieials,⁴ but there is no
record in the roll ot any such prooeedings on the Winchaster manors.

Having described? so §ar as is possible, the bishop's centn}
audit, we now ask: where was it held? Evidenoe from the late thir-
teeuth century register οὶ John oi Pnntoise‘ proves beyond question
