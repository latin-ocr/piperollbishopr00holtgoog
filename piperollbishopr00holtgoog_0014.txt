INTRODUCTION

1. Tun Docuunnr
A. Tho Diplomaeio

Tim document wusists of eleven parchment membmoe of uneqnal
length. varying between 29 inchae (membr-ane ⁶). and 32 inches
(membrana 4). The average width ot the membra-na is 13} iuehae,
each therefore being as wide οε, but slightly longer than, the mem-
bmne oi an Exchequer pipe roll.¹ The membr-ures are very faintly
ruled with horizonta] lines about a quarte: of an inch ape-rt, whilst
two saint vertical lines, approximately 1} inchee {rom each edge οὶ
the membrane. form two margins. Theoe is an average of 9⁰ lineo ot
writing to each side of the membrana. Only half oi the dorse of the
last membrane, consisting of 53 lines, is written upon. The rost has
been left completely blank, except that at the ioot of the membr-ane
the roll is dated 'annus sextus'. This is written in the cursive hand
οὶ the scribe and repeated in capitnls in a much later hand. Further
marks of identification, also in a cursive hand, sse not fully decipher-
able.

Like the pipffi of an Exchequer pipe roll· the membranes were
originally stitched together at the head by leather thongs, fragments
oi which still remnin. The leot ot each membnne is tapered οῦ
slightly to a blunt end. The consecutive numbers of the membranas
have been written in mbic numerals at a much later date on the
iace οἱ endi ioot, and above thern, across the whole width 01 the toot,
the ser-ibe has written the names oi the mamers in bold Gothic
eapitals. This closely resembles the method οἱ engrosing used at the
royal Exchequer, with the differente that on an Exchequer pipe roll
the namus οἱ the enunties were engmssed on the dorse at the tuot of
each pipe. The accounts on the proeent roll are continuous {rom
membra-ne to mmbmne, and the document dm not have the
appearance oi being comprised οἰ rotulets or pipes, eanh consisting
of two membranes, as in the Exchequer rewrds. The present docu-
ment thereiore is not technieally a ‘pipe mll' at all in the Exchequer
