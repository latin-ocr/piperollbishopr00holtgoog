A sudden return to the older form in the second membrane, and the
continual use therealter ot both fon-ns, tends to create some oon-
fusion between the ‘f’ and the ἐἰ particularly as the sex-if is often
exaggeratedi There is a haphazasd use ot capital letters, and the
capital ‘G' is frequently preferred to the small 'g'. Persona] names,
particularly those appa-ring in the ‘Purchasia' sections, are spelt
inconsistently, and it is interesting to note that vernaculas fon-ns
(Inguli, Osgod, Osbert¹ etc.) ase found along with the latinized iorms
of Anglo-Norman names.

The roll ooutains the accounts οἱ some 37 mauors together with ¹
an account oi the rnill at Southwark, the sei-tage for 1210-11 and
the account of the market of Ali-§ford under separate headings. The
roll of moero included the accounts of 37 manum, of which Privet,
Fawley and Ower, taken together, in Hampshire, and Bishop's
Fonthill in Wiltshire do not app-m· in the pieseut roll as independent
manors. In κιο-Π, the mauors ot Fawley and Ower along with
Stanham were let out at tasin and the record ot the rent paid by the
‘firmarii' appears at the head of the first membrane. This may partly
explain why some mauors, appear-ing in one roll as capital rnanors,
appear in another ml] as sub-manem only. In 1210-11 Bishop's
Fonthffl is included in the account oi Knoyle, whilst enti-ies relat-ing
to expenses incuned at Privet in this year occur in the accounts
of Alxffiord and Wield. The accounts oi North Walthasn, Bentley,
Combe md ⁰1 the bishop’s lands in the Isle oi Wight are enrolled
in the praeut roll, though they do not appear in the 12089 roll.
Of these rna-nors North Walthasn was pmbably held at tasin in
1208-9‚ which would amount tor its mniffiion horn the roll οἱ that
year.¹ lt is obvious that the 37 manors entered on the proeent roll do
not represent a complete list ot the bishop's possessione in κιο-ιι.
Α glanoe at the eutr-ite on later rolls confiniis this, Bishopstoue and
Ivinghoe. both acquir-ed before 1086. being the most uotable omis-
sions. Such diserepanciae are not the mult oi an irregulas system of
audit-ing. It such manure cannot be proved to have been held at fan-n,
the explanation my be that they were either temporarily alienated,
or were the subject of dispute between the bishop and the prior and
convent of St. Swithun's.²
