was to reveal how iar the obligations which a lord might expect
from his officials and tenants had been fulfilled.

Α system of regulas views held loeally leading to an annual een-
tmlized audit 01 account was in operation on the Winchaeter estates.
At this time the episcopal exchequer might well have been held at
Southwask rather than at Wolvaeey. The bishop's knights, aided by
his chanoery clerks, {orm the bukbone ⁰1 his financial organization.
Οἱ camera] finanoe we have found little upon whieh to base any
general conclusions. At the head oi the whole organization stands
John the Dean, the bishop's treasurer. and Denis, his chamberlain,
two rather shadowy figures.

The bishop's lega-l jurisdiction may be divided somewhat arbi-
trarily into a domania] jurisdiction, exercised iu the mmor and
hundred murts, and a franchisal jurisdiction, exercised in the bi-
annual court leet. There is a signifioent omission οἱ any reference in
the rol] to an honour court. The mll provides numerous exemplet 01
the business 01 the maneria] wurts, but has little or nothing to say
about the composition, or the procedure tollowed in any one 01 them.

We have dismissed the functionis 01 the membets 01 the bisbep‘s
hoissehold. aud particularly the members 01 his chancery. We have
noted the adsninistmtive importance 01 the bisbop’s military tensius,
aud the prominente that several oi them were to athieve as royal
servants In describiug the local manorial executive oi bailifl, reeve,
and beadle, little that is new may be said. These officials were super-
vised by a oentral bureaucxacy headed by the bishop's steward,
apparently assisted by two officials of sornewhat lesser importanoe.

footnotae, a glossary ot the more obscure Latin tenus, and index& oi
pensons and places mentioned in the roll and ot those officials
