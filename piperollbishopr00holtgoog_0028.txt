we might expect, but London.¹ Again, the political activities of the
bishop would make Southwask u more obvious choice than Wolvffiey
as a place οἱ audit and receipt, and Southwark was aJxeady the
economic uentre of the estates· What was more natural. and indeed
more convenient, than that the hishop’s revenues should be audited
