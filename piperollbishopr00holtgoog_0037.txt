the payment οἱ forty shiuings to the sheriff of Somexset 'pro oon-
suetudine hundredi' ¹ proves that hm, at least, the view was not
held without some recognition οἰ royal authority. Willinm Melet,
sherifl 01 Somerset and Dorset, was praeut at Taurinou ior at least
one day in the year.¹ He may therefore have been actually present
at the leet, either as an observet representing the Crown. or he may
have heard Crown plens in conjunctim with the bishop's hundreda!
bailffi. Cousidering the nature of our document we would expect to
find some moord somewhere of other simila-r payments. We do not,
and can reasonably εὕει-ἱ that the bishop held the view quite in-
dependently of the sheriff, the situation at Taunton being exception-sal.
and more puzzling since it was the greatest οἱ the bishop's hundreda]
mauors.

The profits oi the view arose (rom amercements levied upon the
tithings ior the oonoeajmeut ot offences committed by their members,
and ior the eonoealment of persons who ought to have been membeis
of a group. (rom amereements for non-attendanoe at the view, imm
payments ⁰1 the tithing penny, sud imm certain sums paid (or
unspeeified reasons.

The system οἱ ‘double prosentment’ used at the view was first
discussed by Maitland, ¹ and has since been elaboranti upon by
Heamshaw and Mortis, ⁴ and need not detain us here. Failure by
the ehiesspledge to repert my misdemeanours committed by the
membeis οἱ his group, the roll describes it as 'concealsnentz was
punishable by a heavy asnercement levied upon the whole tithiug.⁸
The tithing was again heavily asneroed tor the ‘cuneealment' oi men
who ought to have belonged to a ἔποψ.. In many respects the tith-
ing as a whole wa in a similar position to the individual suitor in the
hundred court, being amerced ior {silure to perform suit of court,'¹
and for contempt oi court! The tithings oi North and South Twy-
ford' were ameroed 'pro deiectu’, which may reier to suit oi oourt.
